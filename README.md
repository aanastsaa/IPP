# IPP
This is my big project for the IPP subject at the university. It is divided into two tasks and two languages were used for implementation - Python, PHP.

You can read more about the project, its requirements and the exact task in the - "ipp24spec" file. 
The first task of the Python project was implemented in the "parse" folder. The second task was implemented in the "inter" folder.
